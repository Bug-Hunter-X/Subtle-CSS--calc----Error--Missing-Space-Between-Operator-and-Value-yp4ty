The corrected CSS code snippet is shown below:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  /* Correct: Space between operator and value */
  height: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

Adding the space ensures that the browser correctly parses the mathematical expression, leading to the expected height calculation.
